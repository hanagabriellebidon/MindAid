      <ul>
      <li>Talking openly about suicide lowers anxiety and enables the person to talk about their emotions.</li>
      <li>When assessing the risk of suicide, use these four steps:</li>
      <li>Intent: Does the person have the desire to kill themselves?</li>
      <li>Plan: Does the person have a solid plan to take their own life?</li>
      <li>Means: Does the person have anything to kill themselves with them near them (e.g. gun, knife, rope, etc.)?</li>
      <li>Timeframe: Does the person know when they're going to kill themselves within 24 hours?</li>
      <li>If the person says yes to all four steps of risk assessment, they're at imminent risk.</li>
      <li>Come up with a safety plan, if the person is willing to do that.</li>
      <li>If the person is unwilling to come up with a safety plan, call 911 immediately.</li>

      <li>Don't provide empty promises. For example, don't promise someone that they will have a better day tomorrow.</li>
      <li>Do ask them what brings them joy to focus on something pleasant rather than them continuing to wallow on their negative thoughts.</li>

      <ul>
      <li>Ask the person if they're harming themselves with the intent to die. If the person says yes, use the ladder-up risk assessment for suicide.</li>
      <li>Misconception bunked: People who self-harm don't necessarily have a mental illness. Common motivations for self-harm are to distract themselves from emotional pain, punishing themselves for bad behavior, and a sense of europhia in the short term.</li>
      <li>Don't judge a person who self-harms because they may do it for various reasons as mentioned above.</li>
      <li>Identify healthier coping mechancisms to deal with their emotions (e.g. drawing on parts of their body that they usually self-harm, listening to music, etc.)</li>
